# DemoDrop- a general purpose online music demo marketplace (back end web project)

## <ins>About</ins>
Welcome to DemoDrop, a general purpose online marketplace where music producers can upload their demos and sell the rights to DJ's and other parties that are interested in playing said music.
DemoDrop is continuously being developed by Gerard Heuvelman, as the final assignment of the bootcamp Full Stack Dveloper of Novi University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.

At this time, DemoDrop exists solely as a source-code only prototype, and as such still requires an IDE to run. 

### Version
1.0

### Known bugs
None.

## <ins>Main usages</ins>
DemoDrop offers the following functionality:
- Uploading demos. 
- Searching for demos.
- Listening to a demo (online).
- Downloading a demo.
- Sending a message to a demo owner.
- Replying to received messages.
- Extensive administrative functionality.

## <ins>Installation guide</ins>
Steps below are only to install and deploy this (back end) portion of the Demo Drop Web application. You must also install and run the front-end project, which can be found at https://github.com/gerardheuvelman/-novi-frontend-demodrop.

### Prerequisites
- OS: Windows, MacOS or Linux.
- Java JDK 17 or higher needs to be installed on your system
- PostgreSQL must be installed on your system. Also
- PGAdmin 4 (or higher) must be also be installed.

### Installation steps:
1. Clone this project (Spring boot backend  project for the "DemoDrop" web app)
2. In PGAdmin, create a new database named "demodrop". Take note of your login credentials.
3. Open the project in an IDE.
4. At the root level of the project, create a file called ".env" and write the following lines in it, replacing the [EXAMPLE DATA]:
   - MAIL_SMTP_SERVER = [smtp.gmail.com]
   - MAIL_SMTP_PORT = [587]
   - MAIL_USERNAME = [myemail@gmail.com]
   - MAIL_PASSWORD = [Rumpl3$t1lt$k1n]
   - DATASOURCE_URL = [jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/demodrop]
   - DATASOURCE_USERNAME = [postgres]
   - DATASOURCE_PASSWORD = [myp0$tgr3$p@$$w0rd]
   - CLIENT_APP_URL = [http://localhost:3000]
   - UPLOAD_FOLDER: [uploads] (to use the test data, copy this setting exactly)
5. install dependencies by typing "mvn install" in a terminal window.
   Optionally, You can set the following properties in application.properties:
   - If you want to run the app with an empty dataset (no test data), then set the "spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization=" from true to false.
   - If you want the test data to regenerate each time you restart the app, you can change "spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=" from "update" to "create-drop".
7. Run the project. 
8. Run the frontend project of the same name (using its own instructions). A browser window will appear.
9. Log in as "admin", with password "Admin"
10. Navigate to Admin Control Panel => USer Control Panel => Create Admin User. to create your own admin account.
11. !!IMPORTANT!!  The inital, easily compromizable admin acccount must be made secure. In the user detail page for this account, eiter click on "Edit this user", and change it's password to a strong one, or click on "Delete this user", to delete the admin account in its entirety.

## <ins>Test Data</ins>
Test data is provided in the file data.sql in the folder source/main/resources. This rtest data had one single Admin account called "admin" with "admin" also as the password. All other users in the test data all have "acme" as their passwords. To explore the applications data , you may want to start with loggin in as user "gerard", whoo has two demos to his name, and has active convesations with user "admin" (admin accounts also have all "normal" functionality), who hs uploaded only one demo. 

After exploring this, Try logging in as "admin" to see the other side of the communications. Be sure to then also click on "Admin Control Panel" in the menu bar, to see all administrative functionality of the app, which accounts for about half of DemoDrop's functionality.

In case you decide not to use the test data, you must (before starting the app) either manually create The first admin account using PgAdmin, or rename "data minimal.sql" to data.sql, overwriting the original test data with a dataset containing only a single admin user account. Using this account you can create other admin accounts.

## <ins>Running tests</ins>
To run all unit tests in IntelliJ, right-click the green folder name "java" in the directory /src/test/, and select "Run all tests".
Doing this will also run integration tests, but these will fail due to inappropriate test context. To run the integration tests, right-click the IntegrationTests" folder and select "Run tests" in that folder. In this context all (enabled) tests should pass. 

## <ins>Roadmap</ins>
- implement pagination for large list requests.
- Accept other file formats other than .mp3.

# <ins>TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION</ins>

## Test Requests
Although the app features 75%-80% test coverage in unit tests, there is currently only one single set of integration tests (for the "Demo" request paths). To make up for this shortcoming, I have made an extensive list of 81 test request using the Postman API platform. Some of these are requests that are meant to fail as they are considered illegal according to the "associative security" logic implemented on nearly all routes (making these so-called "secure" routes actually secure).

To get and mount the full list of test data in JSON format, see the file "DemoDrop.postman_collection.json", that is included in the root folder of the project. This file can be imported into the "Postman" app, allowing you to test all endpoints extensively, which you should probably do, before you decide to fully trust the functionality and security of this product.

## Associative security:
Associative security (or associative authorization) is what I have named the extra layer of security (on top of Spring Boot's "standard" security) that I have built into all so-called "secure" request routes. In a nutshell, the logic (different logic for each route) simpl checks the object the user  is trying to create, access, alter or delete, against the contents of hte JWT that is sent along with the request, and checks to see if the presented identity is either the "owner" of this data, or otherwise, has a valid associative "need to know" relationship with it.

For instance, when a user makes a PUT request to /conversations/{conversationId}, the extra logic (implemented in the Service layer) checks the identity of the user, making sure that this user is either the producer of the demo that is associated with this conversation, or the interested user, who had initially inquired about this demo in the first place. If the found identity is neither of these, The request is denied, returning 403 Forbidden.

This layer of security is automatically overridden when the user making the request has admin privileges.

## Data Transfer Objects

When making requests to Demodrop's Public API, knowledge of the structure of DemoDrop's Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) is required.
